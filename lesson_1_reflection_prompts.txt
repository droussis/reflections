commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google

    The basics pros have to do with working with a team, as everyone can

    and actually block one's train of thought.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because texts usually form a single theme, while Git is focused on a single
    part of a project, which can contain multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that

    I know that I can always check older versions and see what went wrong

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
